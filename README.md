# syslog-yard

One yard, three tools — an open-source, self-hosted syslog toolkit, deployed as
simple containers under a single compose file:

- **syslog-hose** — generates random-but-realistic syslog traffic at a configurable rate
- **syslog-valve** — visual router/filter built on syslog-ng: graphical IN/OUT ports,
  filtering in between, disk caching with logrotate-managed retention
- **syslog-bucket** — syslog server and triage UI modeled on an email client

Each tool runs standalone; together they form a complete loop —
generate → route/filter → store — on one internal bridge network, with UIs on
ports 8080 / 8081 / 8082 and optional external NAS shares for log storage.

See [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) for the build plan. Status: planning / S0.
